                  <p class="card-text">Yamini Tumu</a> is a 12th-grade student studying the subjects of Maths, Economics and Commerce. Her interests are diverse, ranging from economics and international law to Kuchipudi. Though her personality is hard to sum up in a few words, some might say she is meticulous and approachable. She strongly believes in the power of a cohesive and harmonious team and hence, tries her hand at broken humor to keep the spirit going. Having consistently attended a considerable amount of MUNs in the past two years, she has developed a decent understanding of them. With this, as the Secretary-General of the DPSHMUN 2024, she warmly welcomes everyone to the conference!</p>

Approachable and determined, he never beats around the bush. Graduating as a student body president from his Alma Mater, Chanakya has involved himself in numerous experiences, making him an asset to this team. He has used a multitude of skills in order to execute every task to perfection and he believes in the law as a tool to shape society into a fairer one. 

                    Being a dedicated law aspirant while balancing his interests in sports and conferences, he brings a well-rounded, dynamic approach to facilitate a memorable MUN experience.

He exudes confidence and does not discriminate with his kindness. According to him, MUN is a platform for one to present themselves and explore the depths of their leadership capabilities. To him, if the problem is the lock, interaction and collaboration are the key. This analogy, which he applies to all aspects of his life, has gotten him closer to MUNs. 

                    He hopes to relay his passion for debate and discussion to all of the participants, and eagerly looks forward to the exhilarating interactions fostered through this conference!

                  <p class="card-text">Venkata Kashvi M. is a person who believes in talking first and thinking next, which lies in contrast to her calm composure. She spends most of her time with her nose buried in books of various genres and playing music at a low volume. Kashvi is an adventurous spirit, dabbling in all sorts of sports, with a particular love for basketball. Despite being teased about her height, she remains undeterred and welcomes challenges. Despite all, she is an ambivert who avoids conflict, yet would not give up a chance to raise her voice for what she believes in. This resolution imbibed in her a passion for Model United Nations (MUN) conferences a year ago and she has excelled in them. 

                    She hopes all of you are ready to learn and wishes everyone all the best.
